# HalleyMethodSQRT
A method for finding square root with cubic convergence. Most square root functions implemented in hardware are either done so by a lookup table or by newton's method. These modules were written as an experiment to show, with not much hardware, you could offer more accuracy than either of the two methods commonly used in practice.
